# Project: Rock Paper Scissors
Simple implementation of Rock Paper Scissors game from The Odin Project.

This is my first HTML/CSS/JS project.
Live version of the game is here: https://mattex-defi.github.io/Rock-paper-scissors/
## First stage | Game in the browser console
### The benefits I got from this stage:
• Deepened knowledge of how functions work with each other.

• Learned how to color the console text.

• Enjoyed stylizing the prompt and console texts.
## Second stage | Game with added UI
### The benefits I got from this stage:
• Learned to use and modify Icons.

• Deepened knowledge of CSS effects.

• Used the debugger.

• Learned basic manipulations of elements styles through JavaScript code (setting attributes, adding/removing classes, changing inline styles and texts).

• Improved my understanding of JavaScript functions (organization, workspaces, scopes, calling, invoking, breaking down into smaller ones..).

I really tried to keep readable and understandable code, short functions and descriptive names.✨
